# [DRAFT] a11y Checklist

Follow the link of the element to see what to check for web accessibility.

Once you finish the check list, validate your component as markup (not as a twig template) with the [markup validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Valid markup is a great foundation for accessible website.

In the component you're working on, you have:

## ☞ [Sections](sections.md) `<section>`

## ☞ [Headings](headings.md) `<h#>`

## ☞ [Links](links.md) `<a>`

## ☞ [Buttons](buttons.md) `<button>`
