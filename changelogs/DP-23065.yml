Changed:
  - project: Patternlab
    component: Page Banner
    description: |-
      Makes the background image optional.
      When there are no BG image the banner height becomes fluid.
      Update fonts for header and the text below it.
      Adds a variant for banners without image (organisms-page-banner-as-overlay-no-image)
      Other overlay banner variants are not affected. (#1534)
